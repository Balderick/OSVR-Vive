This is a plugin for OSVR that provides access to the tracker data on HTC Vive HMDs and controllers. It also contains tools to extract a display descriptor with distortion mesh data from a Vive, as well as additional tools that build from source but are not installed into binary snapshots.

## Compiling

To compile, this project requires OSVR, Eigen, and Boost, as well as the submodules included in the repository (clone with `git clone --recursive`). Compile as you would other CMake-based projects, setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to show the way to dependencies in general. You may need to set `EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR` specifically.

You may also use a pre-compiled set of binaries from the project. They're available from <http://access.osvr.com/binary/vive>
